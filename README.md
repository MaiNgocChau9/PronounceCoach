```console
$ pip install openpronounce
$ openpronounce recording.wav "Hello, how are you?"
Score        : 59.0/100
Transcription: HELL NO WHO ARE YOU
Heard phones : /h ɛ l n oʊ h u ɑɹ j u/
Mispronounced:
  - hello: expected /həloʊ/, heard /hɛlnoʊ/ (confidence 89%)
  - how: expected /haʊ/, heard /hu/ (confidence 50%)
```

Azure Speech, SpeechAce or ELSA sell this behind an API key and a per-minute price. OpenPronounce is the MIT-licensed building block for language-learning apps, EdTech products and research: no key, no billing, and your learners' voices never leave your servers. English is the calibrated language; French, Spanish, German, Italian, Portuguese and Dutch work too, experimentally.

## Install

Python 3.10+, plus `ffmpeg` and `espeak-ng` on the system (`apt install ffmpeg espeak-ng`, `brew install ffmpeg espeak-ng`).

```bash
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu   # CPU wheels, much smaller
pip install openpronounce
```

Two Wav2Vec2 checkpoints (~1.2 GB each) are downloaded from the Hugging Face Hub on first use: one for words, one for phones.

## Use it

**Command line**

```bash
openpronounce recording.wav "Hello, I am a developer"
openpronounce recording.mp3 "Hello, I am a developer" --json --no-prosody   # machine-readable
openpronounce bonjour.wav "Bonjour, je suis développeur" --lang fr
```

**Python**

```python
from openpronounce import load_audio, compare_audio_with_text

sound = load_audio("recording.wav")          # any format ffmpeg reads, resampled to 16 kHz mono
result = compare_audio_with_text(sound, "Hello, I am a developer")

print(result["score"])                       # 98.93
for err in result["differences"]["errors"]:
    print(err["word"], err["expected"], "->", err["actual"] or "(missing)", err["confidence"])
```

Every function takes `lang="en"`. Lower-level pieces are exposed too: `transcribe`, `transcribe_phones`, `get_phonemes`, `compare_phones`, `compare_transcriptions`.

**Web app**

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 $(docker build -q .)     # or: pip install -e ".[app]" && uvicorn server:app
```

Then open http://localhost:8000: record from the microphone or drop a file, pick the language, get the score and the words with their wrong sounds highlighted. Microphone access needs `https://` or `localhost`. GPU: `Dockerfile.gpu` and `OPENPRONOUNCE_DEVICE=cuda` (CUDA is picked automatically when available).

## What you get

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `score` | 0-100 |
| `transcribe` | what the word recognizer heard |
| `differences.errors[]` | one entry per mispronounced or missing word: `word`, `position`, `expected` and `actual` (IPA), `confidence` (0-1), `phones[]` with `expected`, `heard`, `confidence` for each sound |
| `differences.heard_phones`, `differences.expected_phones` | every sound recognized in the audio (with `heard_phones_confidence`), and the sounds expected for each word |
| `differences.phoneme_error_rate`, `differences.word_error_rate` | edited sounds / expected sounds, edited words / expected words |
| `acoustic_distance` | mean per-frame DTW distance between the learner's Wav2Vec2 embeddings and a synthetic native reading |
| `prosody.f0`, `prosody.energy` | pitch and loudness contours |
| `differences.expected_vector`, `differences.transcribed_vector` | aligned phoneme traces, ready to plot |

## How it works

1. A Wav2Vec2 model fine-tuned on espeak labels (`facebook/wav2vec2-lv-60-espeak-cv-ft`) recognizes the sounds actually said, straight from the audio. No language model gets a chance to "correct" the learner.
2. The sentence is phonemized with espeak-ng in the selected language. Both sequences are normalized (length marks dropped, and for English reduced vowels, cot-caught merger and a few function words with two accepted forms).
3. Expected and heard sounds are aligned by edit distance. Each wrong sound gets a confidence from the CTC posteriors: full for a clear substitution or deletion, half for a close one (voicing, tense/lax vowel), less at word ends, and scaled down when the expected sound was itself plausible in those frames. A word is reported when the confidences add up to 40 % of its sounds, or to two sounds.
4. The audio is also transcribed with `facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h` (English) or a language-specific XLSR checkpoint, for the transcription and the word error rate.
5. The sentence is synthesized (gTTS by default, Piper or Kokoro offline), both recordings are encoded with Wav2Vec2 and aligned with DTW: that is the acoustic distance.
6. Pitch (pYIN) and RMS energy give the prosody curves.

The score is `0.3 × acoustic + 0.4 × (1 − phoneme error rate) + 0.3 × (1 − word error rate)`, each term clipped to [0, 100]; the acoustic term maps 6 (100) to 15 (0) in English, with a per-language baseline for the others. Weights and bounds were fitted on 500 [speechocean762](https://github.com/jimbozhang/speechocean762) utterances rated by experts: Spearman ρ = 0.65 with the human total, 0.83 per speaker. A heavier acoustic weight would fit that corpus a little better but would stop punishing a wrong sentence. Details, scripts and word-level precision/recall in [benchmarks/](benchmarks/README.md); constants in `openpronounce.speech` and `openpronounce.phones` if you want to recalibrate on your own data. The original idea is described in [this blog post](https://blog.lepine.pro/en/ai-wav2vec-pronunciation-vectorization/).

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `OPENPRONOUNCE_TTS` | `gtts` | reference voice: `gtts` (network on first use of a sentence), `piper` or `kokoro` (offline, `pip install openpronounce[tts-piper]` / `[tts-kokoro]`). See [docs/reference-voice.md](docs/reference-voice.md). |
| `OPENPRONOUNCE_TTS_VOICE` | per engine | voice id (`en_GB-cori-medium`, `af_heart`, gTTS domain `co.uk`...) |
| `OPENPRONOUNCE_DEVICE` | auto | `cpu`, `cuda`, `cuda:1`, `mps` |
| `OPENPRONOUNCE_QUANTIZE` | off | `on` for int8-quantized Wav2Vec2 models on CPU (~1.5-2x faster forwards, slightly less accurate); TF32/fp16 always used on CUDA |
| `OPENPRONOUNCE_TRIM` | on | drop leading/trailing silence before the models, with a 300 ms safety margin so soft onsets and fading tails are never cut; `off` to keep everything |
| `OPENPRONOUNCE_WARMUP` | on (server) | load the models and prime caches right after boot, in a background thread, so the first request is not slow |
| `OPENPRONOUNCE_PROFILE` | off | set to `1` to log per-stage timings (trim, embeddings, reference, dtw, words, phones, prosody) |
| `OPENPRONOUNCE_PHONEME_MODEL` | espeak model | `off` to skip the phone recognizer (word errors then come from the transcription, less precise) |
| `OPENPRONOUNCE_CACHE_DIR` | system temp | where synthesized references are cached |
| `HF_HOME` | `~/.cache/huggingface` | where the models live; `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1` works once they are there |

## Limitations

- Only English is calibrated against human ratings. The other languages reuse the English phone thresholds and score weights (only the acoustic baseline is per language) and rely on community XLSR models for the transcription; recordings from native speakers would help.
- Wav2Vec2 was trained on read speech by adults. Strong accents, children and noisy recordings degrade the recognition, and therefore the feedback.
- The phone recognizer has its own error rate (about one sound in ten on a clean native reading), so expect an occasional false alarm on short words. On speechocean762, one flagged word in five is rated as mispronounced by the human raters, for seven in ten of the words they reject. This is a calibrated heuristic, not a model trained on annotated learner speech.
- With gTTS, the first analysis of a sentence needs the network. Piper or Kokoro make it fully offline.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Hosted demo (the Docker image is ready, `scripts/sync_space.sh` pushes it to a Hugging Face Space)
- [x] Phonetic costs inside the alignment itself (`phones.weighted_distance`: close phones align as one substitution instead of delete+insert cascades)
- [ ] Human calibration for French, Spanish, German, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch
- [x] PyPI package, offline TTS, per-phone confidence, other languages, benchmark, GPU

python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
pip install -e ".[app,dev]"

Tests need espeak-ng and ffmpeg but neither the network nor the model weights.
